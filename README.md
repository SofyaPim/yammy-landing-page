# yammy-landing-page
## The landing page made with Online Tutorials (https://youtu.be/91Q6RvKvd7o), but some styles have been changed. In particular, the navigation menu in the mobile version is implemented using spans and their rotation when clicked.
## the Sass preprocessor was used.
## Used SVG icons of social networks, which I made myself in Boxy SVG.
## The work of styles and scripts can be seen at https://sofyapim.github.io/yammy-landing-page/
